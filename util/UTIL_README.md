# Util

- This directory uses quanttrader as a library to handle the strategy monitor.
- This directory is a work in progress.
- It contains a launcher for the strategy monitor.
- I will be moving some of the models to this library at a later time.

## TODO:

- Look through [quanttrader](https://github.com/letianzj/quanttrader/tree/master) and confirm the code is accurate and useful
- Move this code to this repo so that it can be edited easily if needed and to remove dependency on quanttrader
